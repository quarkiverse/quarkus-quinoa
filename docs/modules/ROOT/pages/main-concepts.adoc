== How it works

=== The Quinoa build (using npm)

NOTE: packages are installed by Quinoa before the build when needed (i.e `npm install`). See xref:advanced-guides.adoc#install-packages[Packages installation]. Quinoa is pre-configured to work with your favorite xref:advanced-guides.adoc#package-manager[package manager] (npm, yarn, pnpm or bun).

=== Runtime for production mode

When running jar or binary in production mode:

=== Runtime for full Quarkus live-coding

Quinoa (using Quarkus live-coding watch feature) will watch the Web UI directory and trigger a new build on changes. It works the same as the production mode. This option is perfect for small/fast builds.

NOTE: You can differentiate the build for xref:advanced-guides.adoc#build-mode[dev mode]. e.g to disable minification.

=== Runtime for proxied live-coding

When running dev-mode (e.g with npm on port 3000):

NOTE: Quarkus live-coding will keep watching for the backend changes as usual.

See xref:advanced-guides.adoc#dev-server[Enable the proxied live coding].
